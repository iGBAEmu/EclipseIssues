## How to Submit Feedback
To create a new issue (despite the name, it also applies to feature requests and enhancements), click [here](https://github.com/iGBAEmu/EclipseIssues/issues/new). Your title should be relevant to your issue/request. In your description, provide any screenshots, errors, and descriptions relevant to the issue. You should also include steps to recreate bugs (if applicable), as well as your browser, operating system, and system version.

### What Not to Do

The following should never be done:

- **Being Vague** Please be descriptive in what the issue entails. If it's a bug, describe the bug as stated above. If it's a feature, describe it and provide any concept art (if applicable).

- **Duplicates** If your issue is already open, don't make another issue. Instead, describe that you are experiencing the same issue in a reply to another entry. To view current issues, [click here](https://github.com/iGBAEmu/EclipseIssues/issues).

- **Close Prematurely** If you are closing an issue, you are agreeing that it is no longer needed (example: a bug fix was implemented). If you are closing it, please say why.

- **Report Vulnerabilities with GitHub** If you have a possible security flaw, contact a member of Zenith directly, such as @HeyItsShuga or @magnetardev on Twitter. We don't want anyone abusing a vulnerability before it's fixed!

- **Ask Questions** This is *not* an FAQ board, this is a bug tracker. For frequently asked questions, check our Discord, website, or in the app under Help.

## Debugging

Eclipse has a built-in debugger. You can either tap-hold or right-click the settings button or go to settings and scroll down to the debug section. The debugger offers the ability to clear cache, report a bug from in-app, view issues, and run a web inspector. If you ever find any issues with Eclipse and want to help make things easier for us, we recommend that you use the web inspector to see if there are any errors in the console that may be related to your issue.
